## Welcome!

Hi everyone and welcome to the super-fun R workshop on data mainpulation in R. Have you started to use R but have trouble getting your dataset into the right format? Do dates and times confuse you? Do you "fix" your data in Excel before uploading into R? Then this is the class for you!

Required software: 

* R, version 4.0 or above. The latest version is 4.1.2, available here: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) 
* Rstudio, version 1.2 or above. The latest version is 1.4.1, available here: [https://rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  

Required packages: 

* tidyverse
* hms
* readxl
* lubridate

  To load the required packages before the workshop, run this code:
  
```{r}
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
if(!is.element("tidyverse",packages)) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!is.element("readxl",packages)) install.packages("readxl")
if(!is.element("hms",packages)) install.packages("hms")
if(!is.element("lubridate",packages)) install.packages("lubridate")

```


In this class, you will be learning how to download data, restructure it, clean it up, and merge different types of data together. We have broken it into modules. We may not get through them all today, but you can walk though them on your own afterwards.


* Part one [Introduction](IntrotoDataManip.html) - Style, Projects, Functions, Packages.

* Part two [Data Manipulation](data-mainpulation.html) - downloading data, changing variable formats, changing names

* Part three [Data Restructuring](dataset-restructuring.html)- transitioning from wide to long format, summarizing data, merging tables

* Part three [Iteration tools](applyfunctions.html) - Iterating functions, loops, apply functions, split-apply-combine.

* Part four [Dates](Date-manipulation.html) - Date and time classes, conversions, lubridate


Data:

We will be using the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Sacramento-San Joaquin Zooplankton data for this course. You may want to download the data ahead of time in case you have wi-fi issues. Data are available at the links below.

# You can do it!

Remember, the difference between being good at coding and being bad at coding it being OK with copying and pasting from Google.

```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics("googlebook.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("copyandpaste.jpg")
```
