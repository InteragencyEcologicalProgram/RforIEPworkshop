## Welcome!

Hi everyone and welcome to the super-fun R learning session of the IEP workshop. R might seem intimidating, but if you keep at it, it's a super-useful skill. The R learning sessions for the IEP workshop will take place from 8:30-11:30 on the Friday March 20th, 2020, the final day of the IEP Workshop.This will be a hands-on workshop. Be prepared to spend half of the time on coding exercises. Please bring a laptop with a fully-charged battery. We will provide as many power strips/outlets as possible, but you may have to share.

Required software: 
* R, version 3.5.3 or above. The latest version is 3.6.3, available here: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) 
* Rstudio, version 1.2 or above. The latest version is 1.2.5, available here: [https://rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  
* [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 
* and the following packages: LIST PACKAGES HERE!


### R coding for beginners

Lead instructor: Morgan Gilber, USFWS

Room: Sierra 1 

Required packages: 
* LIST PACKAGES HERE!

An introduction to R, geared toward someone who has never used the program before. Topics covered: basic code syntax, reading in data, making a basic plot. 


  To load the required packages before the workshop, run this code:
  
```{r}
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
if(!is.element("tidyverse",packages)) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!is.element("readxl",packages)) install.packages("readxl")

```

Here we would link to the intro-to-R code


### Data Manipulation

Lead instructors: Rosemary Hartman, DWR, and Jason DuBois, CDFW

Room: Sierra 2

Required packages: 
* tidyverse
* hms
* readxl
* lubridate

In this class, you will be learning how to download data, restructure it, clean it up, and merge different types of data together. We have broken it into modules.


* Part one [Introduction](IntrotoDataManip.html) - Style, Projects, Functions, Packages.

* Part two [Data Manipulation](data-mainpulation.html) - downloading data, changing variable formats, changing names

* Part three [Data Restructuring](dataset-restructuring.html)- transitioning from wide to long format, summarizing data, merging tables

* Part three [Iteration tools](applyfunctions.html) - Iterating functions, loops, apply functions, split-apply-combine.

* Part four [Dates](Date-manipulation.html) - Date and time classes, conversions, lubridate

* Potential things to cover if we have time:
  + Detecting outliers
  + Simulting data


### R Coding for Publication-Quality Plots

Lead Instructor: Jereme Gaeta, CDFW 

Room: Sutter

# You can do it!

Remember, the difference between being good at coding and being bad at coding it being OK with copying and pasting from Google.

```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics("googlebook.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("copyandpaste.jpg")
```
