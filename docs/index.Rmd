## Welcome!

Hi everyone and welcome to the super-fun R learning session of the IEP workshop. R might seem intimidating, but if you keep at it, it's a super-useful skill. The R learning sessions for the IEP workshop will take place from 8:30-11:30 on the Friday March 20th, 2020, the final day of the IEP Workshop.This will be a hands-on workshop. Be prepared to spend half of the time on coding exercises. Please bring a laptop with a fully-charged battery. We will provide as many power strips/outlets as possible, but you may have to share.

Required software: 

* R, version 3.5.3 or above. The latest version is 3.6.3, available here: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) 
* Rstudio, version 1.2 or above. The latest version is 1.2.5, available here: [https://rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  
* [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) 


### R coding for beginners

Lead instructor: Morgan Gilbert, USFWS

Room: Sierra 1 

Required packages: 

* tidyverse

An introduction to R, geared toward someone who has never used the program before. Topics covered: basic code syntax, reading in data, making a basic plot. 


  To load the required packages before the workshop, run this code:
  
```{r}
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
if(!is.element("tidyverse",packages)) install.packages("tidyverse")

```



### Data Manipulation

Lead instructors: Rosemary Hartman, DWR, and Jason DuBois, CDFW

Room: Sierra 2

Required packages: 

* tidyverse
* hms
* readxl
* lubridate

  To load the required packages before the workshop, run this code:
  
```{r}
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
if(!is.element("tidyverse",packages)) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!is.element("readxl",packages)) install.packages("readxl")
if(!is.element("hms",packages)) install.packages("hms")
if(!is.element("lubridate",packages)) install.packages("lubridate")

```


In this class, you will be learning how to download data, restructure it, clean it up, and merge different types of data together. We have broken it into modules.


* Part one [Introduction](IntrotoDataManip.html) - Style, Projects, Functions, Packages.

* Part two [Data Manipulation](data-mainpulation.html) - downloading data, changing variable formats, changing names

* Part three [Data Restructuring](dataset-restructuring.html)- transitioning from wide to long format, summarizing data, merging tables

* Part three [Iteration tools](applyfunctions.html) - Iterating functions, loops, apply functions, split-apply-combine.

* Part four [Dates](Date-manipulation.html) - Date and time classes, conversions, lubridate


Data:

We will be using the CDFW Zooplankton data for this course. You may want to download the data ahead of time in case we have bad hotel wi-fi. Data are available at the links below.

* [CBdata.csv](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/RforIEPworkshop/raw/master/Data%20manipulation/CBdata.csv)
* [Stations_GPS.csv](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/RforIEPworkshop/raw/master/Data%20manipulation/Stations_GPS.csv)
* [1972-2018CBMatrix.xlsx](ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton/1972-2018CBMatrix.xlsx)
* [1972-2018MysidMatrix.xlsx](ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton/1972-2018MysidMatrix.xlsx)


### R Coding for Publication-Quality Plots

Lead Instructor: Jereme Gaeta, CDFW 

Room: Sutter

Required packages: effects

  To load the required packages before the workshop, run this code:
  
```{r}
packages <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
if(!is.element("effects",packages)) install.packages("effects")


```


This class will show you how to construct complex plots, plotting multiple graphs at once, different plot sizes using Layout, displaying multiple variables on one plot, stacked area plots, plotting model outputs, graphing aesthetics. This class will use "base" graphics, but some assistants will be on-hand to help users more comfortable with ggplot. The class is broken up into two parts:

* [Part 1]() 
  + Plotting with Dates
  + Axis labels with Greek letters, subscripts, and superscripts
  + Creating a back-transformed second axis
  + Plotting stacked polygons
  + Advanced legends
* [Part 2]()
  + Visualizing linear models
  + Visualizing model uncertainty
  + Adding color scale bars
  + Formatting and exporting figures for publication


Data:

We will be using data queried from the [Zooplankton Synthesis Shiny App](https://deltascience.shinyapps.io/ZoopSynth/). You may want to download the data ahead of time in case we have bad hotel wi-fi. Data are available at the links below.

* [zoop_df.csv](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/RforIEPworkshop/raw/master/Plotting/zoop_df.csv)
* [zooper_delta_smelt_food.csv](https://github.com/InteragencyEcologicalProgram/RforIEPworkshop/raw/master/Plotting/zooper_delta_smelt_food.csv)

# You can do it!

Remember, the difference between being good at coding and being bad at coding it being OK with copying and pasting from Google.

```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics("googlebook.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("copyandpaste.jpg")
```
