## Welcome!

Hi everyone and welcome to the super-fun R learning session of the IEP workshop. R might seem intimidating, but if you keep at it, it's a super-useful skill. 


### R basics


Here we would link to the intro-to-R code


### Data Manipulation

In this class, you will be learning how to download data, restructure it, clean it up, and merge differetn types of data together. We have broaken it into three lessons.

* Part one [Data Manipulation](data-mainpulation.html) - downloading data, changing variable formats, changing names


* Part two [Data Restructuring](dataset-restructuring.html)- transitioning from wide to long format, summarizing data, merging tables

* Part three [Iteration tools](applyfunctions.html) - Iterating functions, loops, apply functions, split-apply-combine.

* Potential things to cover if we have time:
  + Detecting outliers
  + Dealing with dates
  + Simulting data
  + Coding style


### Graphs

This is where there will be info on graphs

# You can do it!

Remember, the difference between being good at coding and being bad at coding it being OK with copying and pasting from Google.

```{r graphics, fig.align = 'center', echo = F, eval = T}
knitr::include_graphics("googlebook.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("copyandpaste.jpg")
```
