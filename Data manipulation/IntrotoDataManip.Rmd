# Style Guide
*Jason*

Some things about writing code are necessary for the code to run. Examples:

* R is case sensative
* Variables cannot start with a number
* Characters must be in quotes

Other things about writing code are best-practice for readability, or are particular to the coder. Examples:

* Be consistant as to how you name your functions, variables, and parameters

  + PascalCase: function names; dataframes; field headings; file names  
  + camelCase: function parameters  
  + lower_case (with underscore): variables  
  
* Be consistant with variable assignment

  + Both `<-` and `=` work. Rosie likes `=`, whereas Jason likes `<-`
  
*  Return after left parentheses
* Keep lines to a max of 80 characters
* Use indents 

But the most important part about your code is getting it to run! 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
include_graphics("itruns.png")
```

## Comments
*Rosie*

Comment your code. Just do it. All the cool kids do it. 

Anything after a `#` is a comment. It won't do anything to your code, but it will allow you to remember what you were doing when you go back to it later. Trust me, you will forget what you were doing unless you put comments in it. Also, when you try to show it to someone else, it will not make any sense without comments.

"But I'm the only one who reads my code! Do I still need comments?"

Yes, yes you do. Also, I highly recommend showing other people your code. They probably have the answers to the problem you spend three hours trying to solve yesterday.

Even Gandalf needs to comment his code. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
include_graphics("commentyourcode.jpg")
```

# Projects and Working directories
*Rosie*

Hopefully you are already working in projects. If not, start one now! They will make working directories and file handling much, much easier. 

```{r}
getwd()



```
this prints the absolute path for our working direcory. From now on we can use relative paths to refer to any file within this working directory. Anything we export will automatically be saved here.


Below is an example creating a function, and then calling that function. Note how in the call each function parameter is on its own line. This allows for easily commenting a parameter to try another argument (see `speciesName`).

```
# create function
LengthFrequency <- function(data, speciesName, forkLength) {
  # do something here
}
# end LengthFrequency

len_freq <- LengthFrequency(
  data = Sturgeon,
  speciesName = "white",
  # speciesName = "green",
  forkLength = TRUE
)
```
# Functional Programming
*Jason*

`R` is a functional programming language. As such, it has certain characteristics that can work to one's advantage.

- everything is a function call
- arguments can be other functions
- functions can return functions

Functions usually require arguments (objects) and the function is applied to that object. Functions will return values. You can see what a function does by looking at it's help documentation. For example:

```{r}

#the function "sd" calculates the standard deviation
#to access help documentation, use the "?" or the GUI
?sd

#you can look at the source code by typing the name of the function directly
sd

```



## Function Call
*Jason*

Lots of the little symbols in R are actually functions! 

Here, we use `iris`, the built-in dataframe in `datasets` package. Below demonstrates the 'everything is a function call' aspect. Commented sections display the much more common use.


```{r func-call}

`+`(9, 8)                      # 9 + 8

`<-`(x, 1:10)                  # x <- 1:10 or x = 1:10
print(x)

`==`(9, 8)                     # 9 == 8

`[`(iris, 1, 2)                # iris[1, 2]
`[[`(iris, 1, 2)               # iris[[1, 2]]

`[[`(iris, 1, "Sepal.Width")   # iris[[1, "Sepal.Width"]]



```

You can also create your own functions. When you write your own function you assign the name of the function to "function(arguments) {code}"

``` {r}
#we can quickly make some data
Sturgeon <- data.frame(species = c("white", "white", "white", "green", "green"), 
                       forkLength = c(200, 34, 58, 22, 46))

# create a function
LengthFrequency <- function(data, speciesName) {
  df = data[which(species == speciesName),]
  length = mean(df$forkLength)
  hist(df$forkLength)
  return(length) 
}
# end LengthFrequency

#now we can use our function over and over!
white = LengthFrequency(Sturgeon, "white")
white

green = LengthFrequency(Sturgeon, "green")
green
```
## Error codes
*Rosie*

You will get errors. Don't be afraid of them. For beginners, error codes are often inpenetrable, but if you learn to read them they can be very helpful! You can also always type them into google.

You will also get warnings. Warnings are also in red like errors, but they may or may not be bad. Always read and understand them, but sometimes they are nothing to worry about. 

```{r}

#see if you can solve these

x <- y

Sturgeon[,4]

sturgeon[1,]

mean(Sturgeon$species)

```

## Packages
*Rosie*

By now, you've probably already been using packages. Packages are one of the great wonders of R. Get used to them! However, there are lots of them and many of them do the same things. Everyone has favorites, so use whichever you are most comfortable with. Unfortunately, there are so many of them that they often have functions that have the same names, which can lead to conflicts. Fortunately, when you load them you should get a warning. You can use `::` to specify which package a function comes from if there are conflicts.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#these are two I mix up all the time
?stats::filter
?dplyr::filter

```
