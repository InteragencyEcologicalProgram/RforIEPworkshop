#	Loops

We've now got our zooplankton data set in a format we can work with, but now we probably want to do some calculations on it. What if we want to calculate annual average catch?

We can do it one year at a time:
```{r}

mean(filter(CBlong, Year == 1984))

mean(filter(CBlong, Year == 1985))

mean(filter(CBlong, Year == 1986))

```
But we don't want to keep copying and pasting! Instead, we can use a loop:


```{r}

output = data.frame(year = seq(min(CBlong$Year), max(CBlong$Year)), Mean = NA)

for (i in seq_along(output)) {
  output[i,"Mean"] = mean(filter(CBlong, Year == i))
}

```
